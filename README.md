## Overview

Fig is React hooks for [xmtp](https://xmtp.org) and [quiver](https://github.com/killthebuddh4/quiver). Use Fig to build secure, permissionless, open applications.

## Features

`fig` is hooks for...

**XMTP**

The [xmtp-js](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js) SDK allows you to send, receive, and subscribe to XMTP conversations. `fig` provides a set of ergonomic hooks for working directly with `xmtp-js`.

**quiver**

`fig` provides hooks to access any live `quiver` backend but works best when paired with a published typesafe API. Click [here](https://github.com/killthebuddh4/quiver) to learn more about `quiver`.

**canopy**

Canopy is a permissionless key-value server for XMTP. You can use `canopy` to build open data protocols. `fig` provides hooks for Canopy's entire API.

**txt**

[txt](../../apps/canopy/) is a completely open, realtime social network powered by XMTP. With `fig` you can add social networking features to your app with just a few lines of code.
